Hello, and welcome to ECKit! Eckit is developed by ECWebServices for web developers like you!

This being Version 3, ECKit has finaly got the overhaul it deserved, but with still keeping it's greatest core features. ECKit comes with an example index.html for showing how well it works now! 

ECKit is named after Elijah Cruz, CEO of ECWebServices. He works the most on ECKit, and never gives up on a project!

New In This Version of ECKit:

1.  ECKit was changed to scss.
2.  Fixed the index.html to look better (credit to shivamsaboo17 for creating the initial design).
3.  Made ECKit more flexable.

Using ECKit:

1.  Link the style.css
2.  Link the respond.min.js
3.  Change the style.scss and the column scss (eckit[columns]col.scss) file of your choosing as much as you like!

Then you're done! Enjoy using ECKit! If possible, please maybe give us credit for the css? It's more free than that cup of coffe in your hand!

ECKit is made free thanks to free services such as GitHub, C9.io, and from people like you!
