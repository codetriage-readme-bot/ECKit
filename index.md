##Notes About ECKit
Here's some VERY notable things about ECKit:

1. ECKit No Longer FULLY Supports IE 6/7/8 As of 2.0, but most features will still work.
2. ECKit is worked on daily, so you can expect plenty of new features with every release.
3. ECKit as of date has had no found bug to date.
4. ECKit uses other projects of ECWS that are still not on GitHub or SourceForge, but expect them soon.
5. ECKit uses Box Sizing Polyfill, a polyfill for box-sizing: border-box for IE6 & IE7.

The ECKit team is now using LESS for building ECKit! This is a big advantage as now ECKit will be rolling out with updates faster
